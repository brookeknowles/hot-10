# Hot 10 Generator

Welcome to the Hot 10! 

Similar to the little infographics posted by Billboard on twitter of the top 10 tracks each week, you can use this to create your own Billboard-inspired charts. 

The website allows you to change the title of the chart and all the entries, and has a handy little save button that will download your infographic so you can share with all your friends!
